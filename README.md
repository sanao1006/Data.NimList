## ++ ([a] -> [a] -> [a])
```Nim
@[1,2,3] ++ @[4,5,6] == @[1,2,3,4,5,6]
```

## head ([a] -> a)
```Nim
@[1,2,3,4].head == 1  
@["abc","def","ghi","jkl"].head == "abc"  
"abcdefg".head == 'a'
```
## last ([a] -> a)
```Nim
@[1,2,3,4].last == 4
@["abc","def","ghi","jkl"].last == "jkl"
"abcdefg".last == 'g'
